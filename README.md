#Project Submission Eth + Avax Proof

In this project we have created three functions under the contract ExampleContract.

First one show use of assert() in solidity. It check if given number is even or not, and if it finds that that given number is not even, then it terminates the execution.

Second one display use of require() in solidity. It check if divisor is non zero, and if it finds that divisor is zero then it terminates the execution and pass the message given to show in case of error.

Third is to show revert() that pass on the error message given to it when encountered and revert all operation performed till then.
